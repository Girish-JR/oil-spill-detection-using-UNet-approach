# oil-spill-detection-using-UNet-approach

PROBLEM STATEMENT
● The detection of oil spills in natural environments, particularly in marine and coastal regions, is a critical task due to the significant environmental and economic impacts they pose.
● Traditional methods of oil spill detection often rely on manual observation, which can be time-consuming, subjective, and limited in coverage.
● In recent years, advanced deep learning methods, such as CNNs and specialized architectures like U-Nets, have proven effective in enhancing the accuracy and speed
of detecting oil spills from satellite or aerial images.
● Applying image segmentation techniques to segment satellite or aerial images into color regions corresponding to oil-contaminated and clean areas.
● We can enhance environmental monitoring efforts, improve response times, and  mitigate the impact of oil spills on ecosystems.

ABSTRACT
● Oil spills pose significant environmental threats, impacting marine ecosystems, coastal communities, and economic activities.
● Detecting oil spills promptly is crucial for effective mitigation and response efforts.
● We leverage satellite or aerial imagery to identify areas affected by oil spills, enabling timely intervention and resource allocation.
● Our approach integrates image preprocessing, feature extraction, and deep learning-based image segmentation to accurately segment oil-contaminated regions.
● This work helps to find oil spills automatically, making it easier to protect the environment and handle disasters.
